# Groovy NullPointerException in Arithmetic Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy related to null values in arithmetic operations.  Groovy's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.groovy` offers a corrected version that prevents potential `NullPointerException` errors.

## Problem

The issue lies in how Groovy handles null values in calculations.  If a null value is encountered in a sum operation, it does not throw an explicit `NullPointerException`, but instead produces an unexpected result (often 0).  This can be problematic as it masks the presence of null values and can lead to incorrect calculations and logic errors.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit null checks to the `calculate` function, which ensures that the function gracefully handles null input values.  This prevents unexpected behavior and makes the function more robust.
